My name is Anna.
I have a husband named Eric.
I have a daughter named Kate and a dog named June!
We live in Oakland and like to go on family walks. 
I work as a librarian, Eric works as an engineer, Kate is a baby, and June does dog stuff.
We just got back from a family reunion in Montana.
And Anna would like to go to Hawaii for Christmas!
